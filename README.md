# UQ Library Technology Training assets

Assets (most of them binary files) used in UQ Library technology training sessions and linked to from the [UQL Technology Training website](https://uqlibrary.github.io/technology-training/).

## Contributing

* Upload files in the corresponding tool's directory. If necessary, split between session sub-directories.
* Name files without special characters, using underscores as spaces between words.
* When uploading a new version, use the same name so URLs don't need updating.
